# No Longer Maintained!

This was my first project that I was truly happy with. However, I no longer have the
mental capacity to maintain this repository. **Why?** Breaking changes. I still
remember trying to update a single package and spending five hours fixing type
errors. Additionally, `discord.js` is notorious for its breaking changes, and I don't
believe they will stop finding new ways to break users' code.

#### Select Menus

|__ file
|
|__ directory
|   |__ directory

    async run(interaction) {
        // customId = `${key}:${customValue}`
        const button = new ButtonBuilder()....setCustomId(`cool-button:${user.id}`)
        const components = [...(button)]
        interaction.reply({ components })
